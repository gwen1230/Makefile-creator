Makefile-creator by le-nei_g
================

script that creates a minimal Makefile

How to use:
You must use python3.x
It must be executed where you want the Makefile to be created

Option :
-c  <dir> ...   create Makefile with dir
-d  <dir> ...   Add dir to Makefile
-f  <file> ...  Add file to Makefile
-rd <dir> ...   Remove dir to Makefile
-rf <file> ...  Remove file to Makefile
-m  <dir> ...   Update dir in Makefile
-h              Help

I would appreciate any feedback or suggestions to improve this script
